---

“Let me take you on a little journey today,” I began, leaning forward so everyone could hear the excitement in my voice.

“Imagine three friends: A developer, a tester, and a DevOps engineer. Each of them has their own laptop, maybe a tablet, or even an old desktop at home. They’re all passionate about building something amazing together—like an e-commerce website.

But here’s the problem: they’re working from different places, on different machines. The developer writes C++ code, the tester writes test cases in Excel, and the DevOps engineer prepares scripts for infrastructure with Dockerfiles and JSON configurations. How will they share their work? How will they make sure they don’t overwrite each other’s changes?

That’s where **Source Control Management (SCM)** comes in. SCM is the invisible glue that holds every team together. It lets everyone contribute without stepping on each other’s toes.

I paused, scanning the class to make sure they were following.

“Think of a **repository** as a special box—a container. In it, you can keep all your files: your code, documents, images—anything your project needs. But we don’t keep this box on one person’s laptop where it might get lost or corrupted. We keep it in a central place, a magical place called **GitHub**.

GitHub is like a giant online library of boxes—repositories. Anyone can create an account and get their own profile, where they can have as many boxes (repositories) as they like. Some of these boxes they’ll keep private—like a diary. Some they’ll make public—like a book anyone can read.

Let’s say I, Ravi Tambade, create a repository on GitHub for a project called **Fundamentals-TAP**. Now, I don’t want to just leave it there on GitHub. I want a copy on my own laptop so I can work offline. That’s why I use a command called `git clone`—it’s like photocopying the box and bringing it home.

But there’s more! Every time I make changes to my files, Git keeps track. It sees when something’s been changed, and marks the file in red if it’s different from the last saved version. That’s called a **dirty file**, and it’s Git’s way of saying: “Hey, something’s changed here!”

Before I send my changes back to the central box on GitHub, I need to **stage** them—kind of like packing my bags before leaving for a trip. I do that with `git add .`. Then I lock those changes in with `git commit -m "message"`, like putting a label on my bag so I don’t forget what’s inside. Finally, I send my packed bag back to GitHub with `git push`.

If I want to see what my teammates have been working on, I don’t call them or ask them to send files over WhatsApp. I use `git pull`—it’s like opening the box on GitHub and grabbing the latest updates everyone else has added.

But let me tell you a secret—why should you care about all this? Because recruiters don’t check your LinkedIn or Instagram to see how good a coder you are. They check your GitHub. They look for green dots on your profile—each dot shows you made a contribution, a change, a commit. The more green dots you have, the more active and passionate you look to employers.

I leaned back, letting the silence sink in.

“You see,” I said, “Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, built Git so he and thousands of developers around the world could work together, growing Linux into the powerful system it is today. If he could do it—so can you. Start your own projects, invite friends, build your dreams, and showcase your skills.

Remember: Instagram is for sharing memories, LinkedIn is for professional connections, but GitHub is where you prove your coding skills to the world.

So today, I want each of you to create your own GitHub account, make a repository, clone it, modify a file, commit your changes, and push it back. Show the world you’re ready to code!”

I smiled as I looked around the room, seeing the spark in their eyes—the same spark I had when I first discovered the power of Git and GitHub.
